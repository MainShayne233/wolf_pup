	%h3 Wolf Pup's goal is to make it easier to ask Wolfram Alpha questions that involve complicated math
	%span There isn't much of a reason to use Wolf Pup if your math is simple like 
	.mathquill-embedded-latex
		\\sqrt{x}
	or
	.mathquill-embedded-latex
		e^x
	%br
	%br
	%span However, Wolf Pup proves usesful when your math is a bit more complicated, such as
	.mathquill-embedded-latex
		\\frac{\left(5e^2 + \int_{\frac{\pi}{3}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sqrt{1+sin^2\left(x\right)}dx\right)}{\sqrt[4]{5}-\log_45}
	%br
	%br
	%p 
		If you were to input this into Wolfram Alpha, your search would look something like: 
		%br
		(((5e^(2)+(integral ((((pi))/(3)) to (((pi))/(2))) (sqrt(1+sin^(2)(x))))))/((4th root of (5))-log4 5))
	%p Not only is that long and cumbersome to type out, but there are so many paranthese to account for. Wolf Pup tries to make this as quick and easy as possible


	%h3 How to use
	%p Constructing your math is a simple as typing in what you can, using the buttons provided for the complicated types of input, pressing the submit button, and does the rest.
	%span However, Wolf Pup is based on LaTeX, a markup language used in scientific documents, especially for displaying math correctly. This means that Wolf Pup also responds to any standard LaTeX input. For example, if you wanted to create a 
	%span.mathquill-embedded-latex
		\\sqrt{}
	%span
		, you would simply type \sqrt followed by a space.
